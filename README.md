# Plate Calculator

I used to use an app on the iphone that would calculate the plates you would need
to put on a barbell for a give weight but the developer stopped supporting it and
it no longer worked.

So I had the idea one night before bed to quickly put together an app that does the
same thing. I also added a 1 rep max calculator. This projects core functions are
functioning properly but it is still a work in progess since I first put it togther
in haste.

Let me know if you have any ideas or features you would like to see!
